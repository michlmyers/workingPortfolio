            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m a motivated professional with 15 years of experience in the music industry looking for a position as a software
                engineer.
            </p>
            <p> I’ve consistently excelled at cultivating relationships, managing projects, presenting and demoing applications
                to large groups, and working with data during my career. I enjoy solving problems and finding creative ways
                to accomplish goals. One reason I'm moving from music toward development is the types of problems I wished
                I'd had the technical expertise to tackle myself, the gaps I saw on the technical side of my job that I'm
                excited to work on filling. Most recently I’ve been cementing my programming skills by building browser based
                games with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.</p>
            <p>As a graduate of Berklee College of Music I was trained to exercise my creativity. In my Rutgers coding Bootcamp
                I’m learning the skills necessary to develop modern looking websites with flawless functionality. Web development
                is the perfect practice to combine my professional, educational, and creative experiences and further my
                career by creating user friendly, dynamic, and aesthetically pleasing applications and websites as a software
                engineer.
